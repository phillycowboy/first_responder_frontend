FIRST RESPONDER PROJECT NOTES --

CONCEPT - A THIRD PARTY EMPLOYEE FILLS OUT A FORM FOR A PAITENT THAT IS BEING TENDED TO BY AN EMS/EMT. THE EMT IS RELAYING SAID INFORMATION ABOUT THE PAITENT (VITALS) TO THE EMPLOYEE.
ONCE THE EMPLOYEE IS DONE FILLING OUT THE FORM, THEY CHOOSE WHICH HOSPITAL IS THE CLOSEST, AND THE FORM GETS SENT TO THE HOSPITAL IN THE FORM OF A PAITENT OBJECT, ONCE THE PAITENT HAS ARRIVED A USER CAN CLICK AN 'ARRIVED' BUTTON IT WILL THEN START A TIMER TO ALLOW THE DRS TO KNOW HOW LONG THE PAITENT HAS BEEN THERE. THE PAITENT OBJECT WILL HAVE A DELETE BUTTON AND A SHOW PAGE TO VIEW CURRENT VITALS. POSSIBLY AN UPDATE FOR DRS TO USE AS VITALS CHANGE FREQUENTLY
