WELCOME TO FIRST RESPONDER 
__________________________________________________

Hello, thank you for checking out First Responder. This app was created for a potential third party to fill out information about a patient that is currently in transport
to a hospital. Say for instance an EMT is getting Vital information through a headset. The person on the other end would fill out the Patient Form and send it to the 
appropriate hospital. Upon arrival, the hospital would already have the information about the patient ready to go. Hopefully this will cut down on wait time for patients
that are in need, as well as human error when communicating with Doctors and or Nurses in between dropping the patient off at the hospital. 

TO GET STARTED 
__________________________________________________

Clone this respository down to your local machine by navigating the green ```Code``` button in the top right corner of this repo. type ```git clone``` in your local terminal
and paste in the SSH Key provided for you from the ```Code``` button. You will have to do this for the backend repo as well which you can find here: https://github.com/phillycowboy/first_responder_backend-
Once you have them both cloned down cd into ```first-responder-app``` for the frontend and ```first_responder_api``` for the backend. Once you are in the appropriate 
file for the frontend type ```npm i && npm start``` to ensure that all of your dependencies are installed. If a new browser window fails to open naviagate to ```http://localhost:3000```
For the backend you are going to want to type ```bundle install``` once all of your gems have been installed run the command ```rails s``` to start your backend server.
Hit refresh in the browser to ensure that all the data has loaded from the API, and you're set!
